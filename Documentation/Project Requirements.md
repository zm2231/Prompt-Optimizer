#### App Overview

The prompting app is a lightweight, macOS desktop application that streamlines interactions with AI models by allowing users to create reusable prompt templates with optional dynamic placeholders (custom variables). Its core value proposition is to help individuals and teams maintain consistency across prompt-based workflows, with one-click optimization features, integration for direct exports (to browsers or clipboards), and secure link-based sharing of prompts.

#### Target Audience

The primary users are professionals, content creators, and developers actively engaged with AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude). Secondary users include collaborative teams needing consistent prompt context.

#### User Flows

A comprehensive workflow includes:  
• Creating a prompt template by navigating to the "Create Template" page, entering base content with optional placeholders, and saving the template.  
• Optimizing the prompt with a single button click to invoke AI-based enhancements that refine clarity and efficiency.  
• Exporting the prompt via clipboard or directly into supported browsers (e.g., ChatGPT interfaces).  
• Sharing the prompt by generating a link that others can import.

#### Core Features

1. **Prompt Templates**: Create, edit, and save prompt templates with dynamic custom variables.
2. **Prompt Optimization**: One-click mechanism to apply AI-driven improvements based on preset custom instructions.
3. **Export Options**: Quickly copy prompts to the clipboard or directly insert them into browser-based AI interfaces.
4. **Sharing**: Generate shareable links to distribute prompts across team members.

#### Tech Stack & APIs

• **Frontend**: Electron.js (for macOS desktop app), React.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, and a rich text editor (CodeMirror or Monaco Editor).  
• **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js, optional Python integration for advanced prompt optimization, and Electron’s IPC for communication.  
• **Database**: SQLite for local storage (with optional Dexie.js or PouchDB for offline-first capabilities).  
• **APIs**: Integration with external AI systems (OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face) and cloud storage services (Google Drive, Dropbox).

#### In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**  
• Development for macOS using Electron.js for desktop functionality.  
• Core UI features for template creation, optimization, export, and sharing.  
• Basic integrations with AI APIs.

**Out-of-Scope:**  
• Cross-platform support (e.g., Windows, Linux).  
• Real-time collaborative editing features or advanced team management (beyond link-sharing).  
• In-depth AI model training or complex fine-tuning operations.
