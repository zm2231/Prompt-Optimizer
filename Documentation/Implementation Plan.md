### Implementation Plan

This plan outlines over 50 detailed steps guiding the manual coding and integration process of the macOS app.

1. [ ] Install Node.js, npm, and Git; initialize the project repository.
2. [ ] Create and configure the project directory with a package.json file.
3. [ ] Install Electron as a development dependency and set up the basic app structure (main process, renderer process, index.html).
4. [ ] Configure the start script in package.json and test the initial Electron window.
5. [ ] Define detailed app requirements, draft wireframes, and set architectural boundaries.
6. [ ] Set up the development environment with Visual Studio Code, ESLint, Prettier, and a bundler (Webpack or Vite).
7. [ ] Configure bundler settings for both Electron’s main and renderer processes.
8. [ ] Develop the Electron main process (main.js) to create BrowserWindow instances with macOS styling.
9. [ ] Implement lifecycle event listeners (app ready, window-all-closed, etc.).
10. [ ] Build a custom menu bar using Electron’s Menu module, integrating macOS dock features.
11. [ ] Establish a frontend framework (e.g., React with TypeScript) and install required libraries.
12. [ ] Create the basic UI layout in index.html with placeholders for dynamic components.
13. [ ] Build reusable UI components (buttons, forms, modals) and integrate Photon or React Desktop for macOS styling.
14. [ ] Apply Tailwind CSS for a consistent design, adhering to the defined fonts, colors, spacing, and layout.
15. [ ] Integrate state management with Redux Toolkit (or an equivalent) to manage user data, templates, and settings.
16. [ ] Develop UI interactivity including form validation, navigational handling, and dynamic content updates.
17. [ ] Implement a client-side router (like React Router) to manage navigation between Home, Template Library, Prompt Editor, Optimization, Export & Share, Settings, and Help pages.
18. [ ] Set up a local backend using Express.js to handle API requests from the renderer process.
19. [ ] Define RESTful API endpoints (e.g., GET/POST for user data, templates, settings).
20. [ ] Integrate body-parsing middleware and error-handling routines within the backend.
21. [ ] Implement secure authentication: build registration, login, logout flows with password hashing (bcrypt) and JWT or secure local storage.
22. [ ] Create the SQLite database schema for users, templates, and settings.
23. [ ] Develop CRUD operations for CRUD endpoints interfacing with the database.
24. [ ] Write database migration and seeding scripts to set up test data.
25. [ ] Establish IPC channels between the renderer and main processes to handle backend API requests.
26. [ ] Replace direct API calls in the frontend with IPC calls for improved security and performance.
27. [ ] Build the Template Editor: implement a rich text editor (e.g., CodeMirror) that supports dynamic custom variable insertion.
28. [ ] Develop the Variables Panel for adding, editing, or removing placeholders.
29. [ ] Integrate a live preview mode that renders the prompt as it would appear when exported.
30. [ ] Create the Optimization Page to fetch and display AI-generated suggestions.
31. [ ] Integrate the chosen AI API (e.g., OpenAI) to execute prompt optimization tasks.
32. [ ] Display metrics such as readability, token usage, and cost estimates on the Optimization Page.
33. [ ] Provide user options to apply or reject optimization suggestions.
34. [ ] Build the Export & Share Page including export formatting (JSON, Markdown, plain text) and preview functionality.
35. [ ] Integrate sharing functionality by generating shareable links or using cloud APIs (Dropbox, Google Drive).
36. [ ] Develop Settings functionality that allows users to switch themes, update defaults, and manage cloud integrations.
37. [ ] Integrate the Help & Support page with FAQs, tutorials, and a contact form.
38. [ ] Implement file system access using Electron’s fs module for saving and loading local files.
39. [ ] Configure notifications using Electron’s Notification API.
40. [ ] Develop offline support through local caching and a fallback mechanism for API requests.
41. [ ] Write unit tests for individual frontend components and backend functions using Jest.
42. [ ] Set up end-to-end testing using Cypress or Playwright to validate complete user flows.
43. [ ] Employ Electron’s DevTools to debug IPC communications and UI inconsistencies.
44. [ ] Package the application using Electron Forge or Electron Builder with macOS-specific settings (icon, bundle identifier).
45. [ ] Test the packaged app on macOS for compatibility, performance, and UI responsiveness.
46. [ ] Sign the app with an Apple Developer certificate for proper macOS security compliance.
47. [ ] Notarize the app with Apple to meet Gatekeeper requirements.
48. [ ] Implement an auto-update mechanism using Electron’s autoUpdater module.
49. [ ] Deploy the finished app via the Mac App Store or as a standalone download.
50. [ ] Monitor application performance using analytics and crash reporting tools like Sentry.
51. [ ] Gather user feedback, fix bugs, and iterate by releasing periodic updates with new features as needed.
